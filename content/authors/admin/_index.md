I am an international graduate student currently studying neuroscience at Western University. I am currently working on the effects of brain stimulation on neural basis of the self, supervised by [Dr. Paul Frewen](https://frewen.ca/meditations/).

My undergraduate thesis was on the effects of long-term cannabis use on the brain with fMRI data collected by the Human Connectome Project.

As an international student from Sichuan, China, and I have 6 years of experience living in Canada working and studying. I am keen on bringing more value for people from my academic and personal experience.

Teaching-wise, I have volunteered for 2 years at Laurentian Learning Center in North Bay teaching adult immigrants English. I have also worked as a math instructor for Mathnasium of North Bay.
