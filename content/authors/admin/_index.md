I am an international graduate student currently studying neuroscience at Western University. Currently working on the effects of brain stimulation on neural basis of the self, supervised by Dr. Paul Frewen

In my undergraduate studies, I did research on the effects of cannabis on the brain with fMRI data collected by the Human Connectome Project.

As an international student from Sichuan, China, I have 5 years of experience living in Canada working and studying. I am keen on bringing more value to more people who would benefit from my experience. I have volunteered for 2 years at Laurentian Learning Center in North Bay teaching immigrants English.

I have also worked as a math instructor for Mathnasium of North Bay. I have accumulated experience in teaching math concepts in ways that would be better understood by students.
